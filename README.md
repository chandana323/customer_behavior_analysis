 Data Analytics Project
 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset using Python, SQL, and Power BI to extract meaningful insights and present them through an interactive dashboard and structured report. The workflow includes data loading, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, visualization, and presentation creation.

 Dataset

The dataset contains structured data used for analytical and visualization purposes.
It includes multiple variables such as categorical and numerical data used to identify trends, patterns, and insights.
The dataset is loaded and processed using Python before further analysis.

Tools & Technologies Used

Python – Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data manipulation and visualization
MySQL Server – SQL queries and data extraction
Power BI – Dashboard creation and data visualization
Gamma AI – Presentation (PPT) creation
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

 Project Steps
1 Data Loading

Imported dataset into Python using Pandas.
Verified structure, column names, and data types.

2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checked data distribution and patterns.
Identified missing values and outliers.
Generated visualizations to understand relationships between variables.

3 Data Cleaning

Handled missing values.
Removed duplicates.
Corrected inconsistent data formats.
Prepared data for analysis and reporting.

4 SQL Analysis (MySQL Server)

Loaded cleaned dataset into MySQL.
Executed SQL queries to extract insights.
Performed aggregations, filtering, and joins for deeper analysis.

5 Power BI Dashboard Development

Imported processed data into Power BI.
Designed interactive dashboards.
Created KPIs, charts, slicers, and filters for better data exploration.

6 Report & Presentation

Created a detailed analytical report summarizing findings.
Developed a PowerPoint presentation using Gamma AI for stakeholder communication.
